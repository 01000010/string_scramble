# string_scramble
A string scrambler made in Assembly/C++.

A simple program that takes a string and scrambles it, then restores it back to its original state.

It scrambles the string by generating pseudorandom positions, the data of the positions generated is saved, so this way we can unscramble the string using this data.

TODO:
  Make a better README.md. Add more detail about the program. Add the rest of the files, and format the code.
